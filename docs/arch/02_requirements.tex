\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{User needs}

\begin{content}
ECAP5 is the primary user for ECAP5-DPROC. ECAP5-DPROC could however be used as a standalone RISC-V processor. The following requirements define the user needs. 
\end{content}

\ureq{U\_INSTRUCTION\_SET\_01}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall implement the RV32I instruction set
}

\ureq{U\_MEMORY\_INTERFACE\_01}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall access both instructions and data through a unique memory interface
}

\ureq{U\_MEMORY\_INTERFACE\_02}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall implement an AXI-Lite memory interface
}

\ureq{U\_RESET\_01}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall be held in a reset state while the user asserts the reset signal
}

\ureq{U\_BOOT\_ADDRESS\_01}{
  The address at which ECAP5-DPROC jumps after the reset signal is deasserted shall be hardware-configurable
}

\ureq{U\_HARDWARE\_INTERRUPT\_01}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall interrupt its execution flow when the \texttt{nmi} is asserted
}

\ureq{U\_HARDWARE\_INTERRUPT\_02}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall jump to a software-configurable address when it is interrupted
}

\ureq{U\_DEBUG\_01}{
  ECAP5-DPROC shall 
}
