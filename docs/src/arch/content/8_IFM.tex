  \subsection{Behavior}

    \begin{content}
        This module doesn't contain any prefetch mechanism as there is no performance requirement for version 1.0.0. This will lead to a performance bottleneck due to the number of cycles needed for fetching instructions from memory.
      \end{content}

    \subsubsection{Normal behavior}

      \begin{content}
          During normal operation, the instruction fetch module sequentially emits memory requests to address stored in the \texttt{pc} register. Upon successful request, \texttt{pc} is incremented to point to the following instruction.

          This behavior induces a pipeline stall due to the delay of the wishbone interface.
        \end{content}

          \label{fig:ifm-behavior-normal}
        \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Reset behavior}

      \begin{content}
          Once a reset occurs, \texttt{pc} is loaded with the boot address before returning to normal operation.

          This behavior doesn't induce any pipeline stall \textit{per se} as the pipeline is reset during this operation.

        \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Resource busy behavior}

      \begin{content}
          The instruction fetch module is capable of handling wait states from memory through the stalling mechanism.
